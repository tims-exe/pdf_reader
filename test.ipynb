In terms of area, it comes to 3,62,000 km2. \\nWater  is found in the oceans  as well as on land. Life is made possible  on earth due to the availability of \\nwater. The hydrosphere has a direct influence on weather and climate  conditions on Earth. This occurs \\ndue to the important role played by the worldwide oceanic circulations . The average depth of oceans is \\naround  3.7 km. The floor  of the oceans  has mountain  ranges  and valleys,  isolated  volcanic  peaks , and vast \\nplains.  Many  of these  mountain  ranges  and valleys  exceed  in size of their counterparts  on land.  As on date \\nless than 10 per cent of the ocean floor has been surveyed.  \\n \\nOCEANS  \\n \\nWater in oceans is saline  in nature. This salinity occurs due to the dissolved materials (mainly salts ) \\ncontained  in it. The mean  salinity  of sea water  is around  34.7 g/kg. The lowest  value  being  33 and highest \\nbeing  36 g/kg. Though  sea water  contains  a mixture  of several  dissociated  salts,  NaCl  is the most  important \\none. Additional  salts are always  added  to the oceans  through  various  processes.  However,  seawater  salinity \\nis stable due to various mechanisms  that remove salt from the oceans . Salt is spread to the atmosphere  \\nwhen  wind  blows  sprays  of sea water.  The salt particles  in the atmosphere  enable  water  molecules  to stick  \\nto it, and this falls on the land with rain and snow . \\n \\na) Oceans  as moderator  of climate  \\n \\nWater  in oceans is constantly in movement  in regular patterns  due to the activity of winds . These \\nmovements of water in  oceans are called ocean circulations or ocean currents . These currents arise due \\nto the interplay  of wind  and water.  Oceans  as Moderator  of Climate  Oceanic  circulations  have  a profound \\nand significant influence in heating up the globe , and hence, its climate. When water moves up from the \\ncolder  and deeper  parts  of the ocean  to the warmer  surface , the heat is carried  with it. Due to the interplay \\nof various factors, the ocean water moves around the glo be, and with it the heat or cold is transferred . \\nThis heat transfer  plays  a major  role in impacting  earth’s  climate . When  extremes  of incidents,  like rainfall \\nor droughts  occur,  the normal  path of the ocean  current  can be disturbed  and climate  change  could  occur.  \\n \\nb) Oceans  as Heat  Reservoir  \\n \\nOceans play a role of a heat reservoir , moderating extreme temperatures .

Of the total ice, about 90 per cent is located in the Antarctic  as ice shelf. nine per cent in \\nthe Greenland  ice sheet  and the balance  in the various  glaciers  around  the world.  It is estimated  that if all \\nthe ice in Greenland  and Antarctica  is to suddenly  melt,  the sea would  rise to an approximate  height  of 70 \\nm. \\n \\nWATER  ON LAND  \\n \\nFresh water constitutes the basis for life  on land. On land, water is found in all the three states. In liquid \\nform . the water  is found  in lakes,  rivers  and streams  and also as ground  water  and soil moisture . The water \\nfound in these sources is fresh  in nature. In solid form  water is found as glacial ice, ice caps and ground \\nice. The fresh water in earth is perpetually being interchanged between the surface of the earth and \\natmosphere by a process of evaporation  and precipitation . This interchange is known as water cycle or \\nhydrological  cycle . In the hydrological  cycle,  solar  energy  causes  water  from  the oceans  to evaporate  and \\nchange to atmosphere vapour . Evaporation  also takes place from inland water bodies like lakes, rivers, \\nstreams, etc.  The evaporated water rises to the upper layers  of the atmosphere, where it is cooled and \\ncondensed . The condensed water falls back  to the earth as precipitated form . Rain, snow and dew  are \\ndifferent forms  of precipitation . The water that falls on the earth runs along the ground and flows  into \\nrivers  and in turn returns to the sea .
